Player's Edge Plus (IGT) Slots for the iPhone iPad iOS

May 17, 2012

This is a version of the Player's Edge Plus Slots from IGT. I took most of the source from MAME, but I only took what I needed to keep the size down. I thought I would just release the source in case anybody finds it interesting.

Theoretically, if you have a developer certificate, you should be able to load the project into Xcode, change the Bundle ID, change the Code Signing, build the app, then finally drop the rom files (unzip the contents) that you legally own into the Documents directory using iTunes, and it should work.

I've tested it on an iPad 2 and iPhone 4S both running iOS 5.1.

The following roms are supported (to a certain extent):

- PP0158
- PP0516
- PS0014
- PS0022
- PS0043
- PS0045
- PS0308
- PS0615
- PS0716
- X002069P
- XP000019
- XP000112
- XS000006
